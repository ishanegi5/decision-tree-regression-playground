🌳 Decision Tree Regression Playground

A beginner-friendly project showcasing Decision Tree Regression using scikit-learn.
The project demonstrates how decision trees can be applied to predict continuous values instead of categories.

📌 Project Description

Decision Trees are not limited to classification tasks. In this project, I explore regression with decision trees, where the model predicts continuous outcomes instead of labels.

This repo includes:

Preprocessing of a real-world regression dataset

Training a DecisionTreeRegressor

Hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV

Model evaluation using metrics such as MAE, MSE, RMSE, and R² Score

Visualization of predictions vs. actual values

📊 Dataset

You can use datasets such as:

Boston Housing (sklearn): Predict house prices

California Housing (sklearn): Predict median house values in California districts

Or any regression dataset from Kaggle

⚙️ Tech Stack

Python 🐍

Scikit-learn

Pandas

Matplotlib / Seaborn

🧪 Evaluation Metrics

Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

Mean Squared Error (MSE)

Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)

R² Score
